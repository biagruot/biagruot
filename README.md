### 🚀 About Me
I’m a Senior Frontend Developer with **8+ years of experience** creating scalable web applications, high-performing e-commerce platforms, and fully automated systems.

By day, I build **mission-critical intelligence software** at [GraphAware](https://graphaware.com) that supports law enforcement agencies in solving complex cases.  
By night, I run **automated online businesses** that deliver digital products with minimal human intervention — from order to delivery.

What I love most:  
- Turning **complex workflows** into clean, accessible UIs  
- Creating **systems that scale profitably**  
- Combining **business insight** with **engineering**
