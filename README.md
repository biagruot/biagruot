# Hey, I'm Biagio 👋

Frontend developer. Can't stop building things.

## What I Do

By day I work on a graph-powered intelligence platform at [GraphAware](https://graphaware.com).

By night I ship my own stuff: voice apps, ecommerce, AI products. Some still live, some I killed. All shipped.

## Open Source

🔧 **[AgentDepot.dev](https://agentdepot.dev)** — Directory of AI tools: MCP servers, plugins, skills, templates.

Most of my work lives in private repos. This is where I build in the open.

## Tech

**Frontend:** Vue.js, React, Angular, TypeScript, D3.js  
**Backend:** Node.js, GraphQL, Neo4j, PostgreSQL  
**AI & Automation:** Claude API, prompt engineering, MCP servers  
**Infra:** AWS, Docker, GitHub Actions
